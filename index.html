                The board has 25 lights, some are 'on' and some are 'off'.
                Clicking a light will toggle it (on to off, off to on).
                It will also toggle the 4 lights next to it(on the left, right, above and below it).
                To solve that puzzle, you have to <b>turn off all the lights</b> on the bord.
